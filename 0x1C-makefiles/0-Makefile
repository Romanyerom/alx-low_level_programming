# Makefile for building the 'school' executable

# Rule for building the executable
all:
	gcc main.c school.c -o school

# Explanation:
# - The 'all' rule is the default rule that will
#   be executed if no specific rule is provided.
# - It uses the gcc compiler to compile the 'main.c'
#   and 'school.c' files into an executable named 'school'.
# - In a more complex project, you might want to
#   use variables for the compiler and flags.
