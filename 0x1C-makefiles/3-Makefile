# Makefile for building the 'school' executable

# Variables
CC = gcc
SRC = main.c school.c
OBJ = $(SRC:.c=.o)
NAME = school
RM = rm -f

# Rules
all: $(NAME)

$(NAME): $(OBJ)
	$(CC) $(OBJ) -o $(NAME)

clean:
	$(RM) *~ $(NAME)

oclean:
	$(RM) $(OBJ)

fclean: clean oclean

re: fclean all

.PHONY: all clean oclean fclean re

# Explanation:
# - The 'CC' variable specifies the compiler to be used.
# - The 'SRC' variable specifies the .c files to be compiled.
# - The 'OBJ' variable specifies the corresponding .o files.
# - The 'NAME' variable specifies the name of the executable.
# - The 'RM' variable specifies the command to delete files.
# - The rules perform the following actions:
#   - 'all' builds the executable.
#   - 'clean' deletes Emacs and Vim temporary
#   files along with the executable.
#   - 'oclean' deletes the object files.
#   - 'fclean' combines the actions of 'clean' and 'oclean'.
#   - 're' forces recompilation of all source files.
# - The '.PHONY' directive declares the rules that
#   are not associated with files.
