# Makefile for building the 'school' executable

# Variables
CC = gcc
SRC = main.c school.c

# Rule for building the executable
all:
	$(CC) $(SRC) -o school

# Explanation:
# - The 'all' rule is the default rule
#   that will be executed if no specific rule is provided.
# - The 'CC' variable specifies the compiler to be used.
# - The 'SRC' variable specifies the .c files to be compiled.
# - The '$(CC)' and '$(SRC)' in the rule are expanded
#   to the values assigned to the variables.
# - This Makefile allows for easy modification of 
#   the compiler and source files without changing the commands directly.
