# Makefile for building the 'school' executable

# Variables
CC = gcc
SRC = main.c school.c
OBJ = $(SRC:.c=.o)
NAME = school

# Rule for building the executable
all: $(NAME)

$(NAME): $(OBJ)
	$(CC) $(OBJ) -o $(NAME)

%.o: %.c
	$(CC) -c $< -o $@

# Explanation:
# - The 'CC' variable specifies the compiler to be used.
# - The 'SRC' variable specifies the .c files to be compiled.
# - The 'OBJ' variable specifies the corresponding .o files.
# - The 'NAME' variable specifies the name of the executable.
# - The all rule builds the executable using the $(NAME) rule.
# - The pattern rule is used to recompile only the updated source files.
# - '$<' is the automatic variable for the prerequisite.
# - '$@' is the automatic variable for the target.
# - This Makefile allows for easy modification of the compiler,
#   source files, and executable name without changing the commands directly.
